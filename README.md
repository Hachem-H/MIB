# Mathematics is beautiful
> "Pure mathematics is, in its way, the poetry of logical ideas" - Albert Einstein

MIB, also known as _Mathematics is beautiful_, is a [YouTube series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-3H77welXhrY2UMMEy7sA1-RTaMoxYsI) that showcases the beauty of mathematics and physics through visualizations and simulations. Each episode explores a different mathematical or physical concept, and demonstrates how it can be visualized and understood through interactive simulations. The accompanying GitHub repository contains all the code used to create the simulations featured in the series. You can use this code to replicate the simulations, or as a starting point for your own projects.

## Project Structure
Each episode and topic has its designated folder, making it easy for viewers to navigate and locate specific simulations. All the code is written in the [Processing](https://processing.org) coding environment, which makes it easy to edit and modify for newcomers. Additionally, the repository includes a comprehensive README file that provides detailed instructions on how to use the code, as well as helpful tips and tricks for users looking to explore the simulations further. 

## License
The code for MIB is released under the Apache License V.2.0. See the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for more details.
