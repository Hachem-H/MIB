# Basic biology simulator

Biological systems are characterized by their intricate structures and complex behaviors. Understanding the basic principles that govern cellular behavior is crucial for comprehending the foundation of life. Simulating these principles through attraction and repulsion forces can provide valuable insights into the self-organizing nature of biological systems. In our simulation, particles represent the building blocks of cells and organisms. Each particle exerts an attractive force towards neighboring particles and a repulsive force to maintain separation. These forces can be implemented using mathematical equations, such as Coulomb's Law or the Lennard-Jones potential, to model the interactions between particles. Through the interplay of attraction and repulsion forces, particles start to exhibit emergent behavior. As particles attract each other, they form clusters or aggregates. These aggregates may resemble cellular structures found in nature, such as cell membranes or tissue-like formations. The repulsive forces counterbalance excessive aggregation, maintaining a dynamic equilibrium within the system. In more advanced simulations, particles can be assigned additional properties, such as velocity and momentum. By incorporating these properties, we can observe collective motion similar to the coordinated movement of cells or organisms. This can simulate behaviors like cell migration, tissue development, or the movement of microorganisms in a fluid environment. The behavior of the simulation can be fine-tuned by adjusting the strength and range of the attraction and repulsion forces. Different parameter values may result in distinct patterns and structures. Experimentation with these parameters allows for the exploration of various biological phenomena and the observation of their simulated counterparts. While the simulation provides a basic understanding of cellular behavior, it is important to recognize its limitations. The simplified nature of the simulation does not capture the full complexity of biological systems, including genetic information, biochemical processes, and environmental influences. It serves as a starting point for educational purposes and encourages further exploration into more intricate models.

## Code walkthrough
The simulation begins by defining a set of atoms represented by instances of the Atom class. Each atom has initial positions (`x` and `y`) and a color (col). In the `draw() `function, the `applyRules()` function is called, which iterates through each atom. For each atom, it calculates the total force exerted by the interaction with other atoms based on their colors and the predefined rules stored in the rules `HashMap`. The attraction or repulsion force is determined by the interaction strength (`g`) between the atom's color and the color of neighboring atoms. The forces are applied to update the atom's velocity (`vx` and `vy`) using a simple averaging technique. The atom's position is then updated by adding the velocity components, and boundary conditions are enforced to keep the atoms within the simulation window. Finally, in the `draw()` function, the updated atom positions are visualized by drawing rectangles of a small size at their respective coordinates, representing the atoms' presence in the simulation.

The simulation incorporates rule parameters to define the interaction strengths between different colors of atoms. The `rules` `HashMap` stores these parameters, where each color has its own `HashMap` that maps to the interaction strengths with other colors. By adjusting these rule parameters, one can modify the behavior of the simulation. Positive values indicate attraction, while negative values indicate repulsion between colors. To customize the simulation, you can experiment with changing the values of the rule parameters. By altering the magnitudes and signs of the parameters, you can observe different emergent behaviors, such as clustering, dispersion, or the formation of distinct patterns. Exploring different combinations of rule parameters provides a way to study the impact of different interaction strengths on the collective behavior of the simulated particles, allowing for a deeper understanding of how these parameters influence the emergent properties of the system.
